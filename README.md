I am a **final-year Information Technology (Hons.) student at IIUM**, specializing in **Business Intelligence & Information Science**.  

📊 My background and hands-on experience in tools like **Power BI, SQL, Python and Excel** have fueled my interest in **data-driven decision-making, data visualization and business strategy**.  

💡 My ultimate goal is to become a **Business Intelligence Analyst** or **Data-Driven Entrepreneur**, leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and support strategic business decisions.  

🌱 Outside the classroom, I actively explore new tech trends, take online courses and engage with professional communities to stay updated and inspired.
